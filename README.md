# Pastebin Clone
JC & EN

For this project we used the DJango framework with the help of CoreyMSchafer and his YouTube tutorials. We also used some of his code for the basis of this project then we built on functionality and features to suit this assignments needs. His code can be found here (https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/tree/master/Django_Blog).Bootstrap was also used to adjut styling and small things like search bar. Code for this can be found here (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/#starter-template).

This project contains 3 main directories.
  1. pastebin
      - this contains all typical DJango files such as settings.py, urls.py and wsgi.py
      - we really only touched settings.py and urls.py for this project
  2. post
      - this App contains everything to do with the posting functionality of this web application
  3. register
      - this App contains everything to do with the users, profiles and password reset of this web application
